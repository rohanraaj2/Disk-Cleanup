# This is a placeholder icon file for Windows
# In a real deployment, this would be replaced with a proper ICO file
# The icon should represent disk cleanup (e.g., hard drive with cleaning symbols)
# 
# To create a proper Windows ICO icon, you can:
# 1. Use GIMP with ICO plugin
# 2. Use online ICO converters
# 3. Use tools like IcoFX or Greenfish Icon Editor Pro
#
# Icon should contain multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 pixels
# Format: Windows ICO with transparency support
# Theme: Hard drive/disk with cleaning elements
