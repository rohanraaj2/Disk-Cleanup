# This is a placeholder icon file for Linux
# In a real deployment, this would be replaced with a proper 64x64 PNG icon
# The icon should represent disk cleanup (e.g., hard drive with cleaning symbols)
# 
# To create a proper icon, you can:
# 1. Use GIMP, Inkscape, or other image editors
# 2. Use online icon generators
# 3. Convert from SVG using ImageMagick: convert icon.svg -resize 64x64 icon.png
#
# Icon should be 64x64 pixels, PNG format, with transparency support
# Theme: Hard drive/disk with cleaning elements (sparkles, broom, etc.)
